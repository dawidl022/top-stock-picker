# Stock Picker

## Mini-project for The Odin Project Ruby Programming course

Given an array of stock values, return the day when the stock should be
bought and when it should be sold for the maximum profit.

After writing some very convoluted functional methods for solving this problem,
it occurred to me the simplest approach would be an imperative one that uses
a classic nested for loop. The imperative script is more efficient too.
